    <h1>Hello (fallback)</h1>
    <p>This app was generated as a fallback because AI Pipe failed. Brief: Build a human-assisted CAPTCHA page. The page generates a random CAPTCHA in-browser (canvas or similar), allows user input, shows entered text on submit, and refreshes CAPTCHA on reload or button click.</p>
